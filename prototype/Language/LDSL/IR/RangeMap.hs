Intermediate form mapping bit ranges in the logical structure to bit ranges
in the physical structure.

There are a few phases of translation handled here. They deal with mappings
of field names to pairs of locations, one in the logical layout and one in the
physical.

In the first stage, these are just the flat bit ranges, relative to the start
of the whole types & layouts, plus the byte order of the fields.

In the second stage, we split these into ranges with a maximum length of 8
bits, and tag them with the byte index from the start of the struct.

In the final stage, we remove the byte order info, manipulating the offsets
to make everything work without it.

The structures of these intermediate forms are similiar, so the same basic
types ('FieldMap' and 'RangeMap') handle each of them. They take an info
type paramter that carries the metadata needed for each stage -- the input
to the first stage has @info = ByteOrder@, the next has @info = (Index,
ByteOrder)@, and the final has @info = Index@.

'chunkBytes' converts from the first stage to the second. The second-to-third
stage translation is not yet implemented.
